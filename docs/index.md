# Lecture notes | Python for ML algorithms

These lecture notes provide a practical introduction to implementing classical machine learning and optimization algorithms using Python.

The goal is to help you understand how foundational methods such as linear regression, gradient descent, and regularization techniques are built from scratch and used in practice. Each section focuses on core principles, supported by clean and readable Python code.

No external libraries are assumed beyond Python's standard tools and, where appropriate, NumPy.

Use these notes as a hands-on supplement to deepen your understanding of algorithmic foundations in machine learning.
